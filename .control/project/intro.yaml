  and on the package's main docstring.
  Like all other entries in your repository's control center, this text can also contain
  dynamic references to other entries. By default, the first occurrence of the name of the project
  in this text is styled as bold/italic and linked to the project's website.

  - title: First Key Feature

      Description of the first key feature of ${{ name }}.
      By default, these keynotes are displayed on the repository's main README file,

  - title: Second Key Feature
    description: >-
      Description of the second key feature of ${{ name }}.
      For aesthetic reasons, it is recommended to keep the descriptions of all keynotes
      approximately the same length.
  - title: Third Key Feature

      Description of the third key feature of ${{ name }}.
      You can add as many keynotes as you want.
      However, in order to keep the READMEs clean and tidy,
      it is recommended to keep the number of keynotes between 3 and 7.
